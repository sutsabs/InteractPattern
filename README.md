Human interactions and human behaviors has been a fascinating and challenging subject of study in recent times. Social network companies, consumer markets, medical industries have been trying to study human behavior to predict the consumer needs, recommend goods, optimize marketing strategies, or in case of medical industry diagnose and study disease patterns. Child psychology and child interaction behavior is very different from an adult behavior. Study of children interaction pattern is very important to understand and improve the development of children. These studies have been used to understand the development in children as well as spreading of highly communicable disease like influenza, hepatitis and measles. Children are prone to these diseases and the pattern study of interaction of children helps to find the propagation and evaluation of the control measures of these diseases. Through this study, we want to find how age, gender, grade affect the interaction pattern in children.
